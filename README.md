### (Obsolete) ISO generator for an automatic installer of a PBX based on Ubuntu and FreePBX

This is a very old script used in the past for a prototype of a PBX, based on Ubuntu server with FreePBX, TFTP server for phone's firmware plus an extra or two.

It is considered obsolete, as this is not being mantained any more, as well as there are newer methods of doing this.
